Hi! This is an impossible list (not a bucket list). The difference is not just in the name, but the entire concept.
Bucket lists are static, impossible lists are dynamic and ever evolving.
These are not the things that I want to do before I die. These are the things that define how I want to live.
Check this [page](https://impossiblehq.com/the-impossible-list-is-not-a-bucket-list/) to see the complete difference.
